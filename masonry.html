      <h2 class="text-centre">The X2X Promise</h2>
      <div><p>At X2X we look to provide a package that helps you and your family, and to ensure you and your loved
        ones
        have everything you need to be happy and healthy, on your own terms. Every office has its own set of benefits
        built around the needs of our employees. Here’s an overview of some of the things that we offer:</p>
        <p><strong>Family</strong><br>X2X supports employees with their family by offering an excellent work life
          balance. We are a flexible company and give you the right balance to look after yourself in order for you to
          look after your family.<br></p>
        <p><strong>Wellbeing and Health</strong><br>As X2X sees the importance and wellbeing of our employees as our
          priority, we offer support and guidance on specific diagnoses as part of our employee assistance programme.
          This includes advice for anxiety and depression, guidance and advice on coping skills, mindfulness and
          relaxation, equality and diversity and emotional health articles.</p>
        <p>Fresh fruit and snacks are provided in all of our offices.</p>
        <p>Our managers have an ‘open door’ policy; a problem shared is a problem halved!</p>
        <p><strong>Culture and Fun</strong><br>We are very proud of the culture we’ve built at X2X. We’re a friendly
          and
          supportive bunch who love to welcome new faces to the business and will always be up for a little after-work
          mixer. As we pride ourselves on being a communicative and dynamic company, you never feel like you're too
          far
          away from the right answer and someone is always there to lend you a hand. As part of our culture, we love
          to
          celebrate our successes from Christmas parties to mid-week lunches to after work drinks; there is usually
          something going on and everyone is welcome!</p>
        <p><strong>Diversity</strong><br>We are passionate about inclusion. We want all employees to feel encouraged
          to
          be themselves and believe that this inspires creativity and innovation. We are building an inclusive culture
          and have created an Equity, Diversity and Inclusion team to allow any member of the company to participate
          and
          have their voice heard. Moving forward, we are looking to partner with organizations with a focus on
          diversity
          and will be continuing to bring in keynote speakers for workshops with the whole company on diversity and
          inclusion. X2X is an equal opportunities employer with a focus on inclusivity and equality for all.</p>
