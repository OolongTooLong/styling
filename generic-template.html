          On March 20 of this year, cinematographer James Laxton, ASC accepted the American Society of Cinematographers
          Award for Outstanding Achievement for his work on the multi-nominated Prime Video mini-series, The Underground
          Railroad. Laxton, who became a member of the ASC in 2019, had been previously ASC- and Academy-nominated for
          his
          stunning imagery in producer/director Barry Jenkins’ Moonlight, which won the best picture Oscar. Among his
          other credits is If Beale Street Could Talk, Jenkins’ take on the James Baldwin novel.
        </p>
        <p>Like his other work with Jenkins, The Underground Railroad uses the power of cinema to examine issues of race
          and humanity. The ten-episode miniseries tells the story of a group attempting to escape from slavery in the
          1800s, but with a strong element of magical realism – in this tale, the underground railroad, which in
          historical fact was a metaphorical name, is an actual railroad complete with engines, tracks, tunnels and
          engineers.</p>
        <blockquote>"THERE’S A DEEP HISTORY THERE WITH BARRY AND ME, AND IT GOES BEYOND LEARNING WHAT A LENS OR A CAMERA
          TOOL DOES"
        </blockquote>
        <p>Magical realism is a literary technique that began in novels. To make it work in the more representational
          world of cinema required a delicate balance and nuanced understanding between the filmmakers. Laxton, who met
          Jenkins in film school more than two decades ago, says that their longstanding collaboration served as a
          strong
          foundation.</p>
