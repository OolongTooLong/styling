        <h1>WE BELIEVE EVERYONE DESERVES THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THEIR BEST WORK.</h1>
        <p class="intro">PIX allows anyone with skin in the game on a production to see, share, collaborate and iterate. Turning friction into flow, frustration into fulfillment, and good into great.</p>

        <h4>THE WORLD'S GREATEST MAKERS UNDERSTAND THAT YOU NEED TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH 'NOT KNOWING' TO ALLOW THE WORK TO BE THE BEST IT CAN BE. YOU HAVE TO EXPLORE THOSE 'WHAT IFS?'</h4>
        <p>But the commercial pressures of filmmaking simply can't tolerate uncertainty. The temptation to fold too early is too great, 'What if?' becomes 'What might have been'. The work dies a little, and a little piece of us dies with it.</p>
        <p>PIX puts communication and project management in a single place with the work in the middle. Any stakeholder, anywhere in the world, can see what is happening the moment it happens.</p>
        <p>When everyone can see, everyone feels more comfortable. Risk doesn't look so risky, 'No' turns into 'Yes' and you can focus on what matters - the work.</p>

        <h4>PIX REPLACES FRICTION WITH FLOW. FOOTAGE IS AVAILABLE THE MOMENT IT'S SHOT FOR IMMEDIATE REVIEW AND COMMENT.</h4>
        <p>Everyone, regardless of their role, can participate in the act of crafting and creating. Not fighting each other but fighting for the work.</p>
        <p>Users know who's seen what and when, allowing for accurate project management and saving time. Meaning more time in service of the good work, not the bad work that bad tools and processes create.</p>
        <p>PIX now connects over 100,000 industry professionals in all the major studios and leading content makers around the world. Over 5000 film and TV projects have used the system to collaborate more effectively.</p>
        <p>Making the work better, together.</p>

        <h4>WE BELIEVE THE SAFER AND MORE SUPPORTED PEOPLE FEEL, THE FREER THEY ARE TO PRODUCE THEIR BEST WORK. WITH PIX THE COMPLETE ENDEAVOUR COMES TOGETHER IN ONE SAFE PLACE TO SHARE IDEAS AND COLLABORATE.</h4>
        <p>All notes, media and metadata are synchronised to PIX and securely shared beyond the physical set. Whether that be to editorial and post, or to a key decision maker half way around the world.</p>
        <p>Through its patented secure global delivery network, PIX allows worldwide access via any device. Nothing is lost in translation because there is no translation, everyone is looking at the same thing. When we say Connected Set, we mean it.</p>
        <p>The power of PIX extends well beyond the actual set. Every aspect of a production, from scripts to storyboard, stills to SFX, benefit from the communication and clarity it brings.</p>

        <h4>ITERATION ISN'T PART OF THE CREATIVE PROCESS, IT IS THE CREATIVE PROCESS - THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 'GOOD' AND 'GREAT'. WITH PIX YOU GET BETTER, FASTER.</h4>
        <p>A platform that gives everyone the clarity, confidence and time to try the ideas that make the work better. Because the real risk is not try to try at all, and wonder what might have been.</p>
        <p>PIX allows you to get out of each others way, out of the way of the work and let it be as good as it can be. Because when the work fulfills its potential, we do too.</p>
        <p>We enable some of the world's greatest makers do their best work, we'd love to help you do yours.</p>
