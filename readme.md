# Styling 2022
#### This Repository is being used to develop base styling for general use.
* The project uses [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) as a preprocessor.
* Overall layout is achieved using [CSS Grid Layout Module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout).
* Establishes [scales](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/responsive-guide-to-type-sizing/) for use in spacing, fonts, breakpoints and colours and utility classes.
* Uses SCSS [logic](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control/if) to generate CSS variable dependant utility class, such as background colour or padding classes `pad-200` or `bg-primary` etc.
* Leverages a common HTML pattern to reliably achieve a range of design requirements.
